 TARDIS Refined is a Minecraft mod for Forge and Fabric which brings the TARDIS from Doctor Who to Minecraft.

## Workspace
TARDIS Refined implements the <a href="https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin">Architectuary Gradle plugin</a>, allowing easy multi-modloader development via a common module. This functionality does not require any additional installation of plugins or files. It is recommended you familiarise yourself with Achitectury first before proceeding with PR submissions. 

This repository has been set up to utilise Forge's data generation for most common data gen items. The repository does not include these generated files, so it is recommended to run the Forge Data task when you clone the repository. It is also recommended to run this task regularly to stay concurrent with your branch's data.
